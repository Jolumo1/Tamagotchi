# Tamagotchi console Java Game

## Project Overview

This Java project simulates a Tamagotchi, a digital pet that requires care. The program allows users to create and manage Tamagotchis by feeding, sleeping, bathing, and playing with them. 
It serves as a learning exercise for Java programming, focusing on object-oriented programming (OOP), arrays, exception handling, and user input validation.
The game is played in the console. All variable names and comments are in Spanish.

## Purpose

This project helps practice Java fundamentals like OOP, input validation, control flow, and problem-solving.

## Key Concepts Studied

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Using classes, objects, and methods to represent and manage Tamagotchis.
- **Arrays**: Storing multiple Tamagotchis in an array for easy access and management.
- **Exception Handling**: Using try-catch blocks to validate user inputs and avoid errors.
- **Conditional Logic**: Handling different user inputs and Tamagotchi states (e.g., alive or dead).
- **Loops**: Repeating actions until valid input is received.
- **Boolean Logic**: Tracking Tamagotchi statuses like "alive" or "dead" with boolean values.

## Main Features

- **Create Tamagotchis**: Create a new Tamagotchi with custom initial values for hunger, sleep, hygiene, and entertainment (1-100).
- **List Tamagotchis**: View all created Tamagotchis with their current status.
- **Care Actions**: Feed, sleep, bathe, and play with Tamagotchis to maintain their well-being.
- **Emergency Check**: Identify Tamagotchis in danger by checking values below 20.
- **Validation & Error Handling**: Ensures valid user input through exception handling.
